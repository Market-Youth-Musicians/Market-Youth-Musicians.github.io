[{"categories":["Photo","Video"],"contents":"Blog Post August 21, 2021\nIn the early, cold, smoky Saturday morning, 5 members of the MYM team arrived in a battle zone. We feared for our lives as we played our instruments, or shall I say, feared for our instrument’s lives as I almost lost the keyboard and the harp as the tent practically flew over our heads. The monstrous wind. It was us and the music against that monstrous wind. The wind whipped our ears so we could barely hear ourselves playing. It was even worse because the wind pulled the sound we made away from us and our instruments, replacing them with dirt and dust. As a contact lens wearer, it was quite the challenge to keep playing while blinking furiously.\n\u0026lt;Insert Aesthetic berries and/or AestheticFlowers\u0026gt;\nBut we felt community. People around us helped us. A lady in a pink shirt from a nearby stall helped us secure our tent with the sad bags. The market manager came over carrying two more sandbags for us. The man at the shaved ice station helped us secure our whiteboard to the tent pole with a huge metal clip. (He told us to return it back to him after, but I’m not sure we did… )\nToday’s experience was different and difficult, but we learned many things as well. Despite a monstrous wind, we could play on. Despite our difficulties, kind people around us stopped to help us out. And finally, we need to fix that bass speaker on the keyboard - why does it keep dying!!! \u0026lt;Insert Anthony+wave\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Insert Judy+3chins\u0026gt; But finally, if we are given the chance, and we see some of our stall neighbors in need of help, let us stop and help them too. This is the power of community. \u0026lt;insert the 4 or 5 youtube vids\u0026gt;\n","permalink":"/blog/saratoga08212021/","tags":["Flute","Harp","Piano","Violin","Saratoga"],"title":"Saratoga 08/21/2021"},{"categories":["Photo","Video"],"contents":"April 17, 2021 at Saratoga.

My name is Judy Liu and I am currently a junior at Basis Independent Silicon Valley. I play the harp and am also the principal harpist for the California Youth Symphony. I have been playing at the Farmers Market since eighth grade. I feel that performing in front of people gives me the opportunity to really self-reflect and has helped me become a better musician. I hope to share this experience with other youth musicians, give back to the community which nurtures me, and bring classical music to everyday life!\nExecutive Vice President - Anthony Wang Hi! My name is Anthony, and I\u0026rsquo;m a sophomore at Monta Vista High school. I play piano and violin, and currently play in the San Francisco Youth Symphony.
