#### Founder and President - Judy Liu
Hello! My name is Judy Liu and I am currently a junior at Basis Independent Silicon Valley. I play the harp and am also the principal harpist for the California Youth Symphony. I have been playing at the Farmers Market since eighth grade. I feel that performing in front of people gives me the opportunity to really self-reflect and has helped me become a better musician. I hope to share this experience with other youth musicians, give back to the community which nurtures me, and bring classical music to everyday life!

#### Executive Vice President - Anthony Wang
Hi! My name is Anthony, and I'm a sophomore at Monta Vista High school. I play piano and violin, and currently play in the San Francisco Youth Symphony. Performing in front of people is definitely a nerve-wracking experience at first, but it can feel extremely rewarding, and I want to bring this experience to other musicians as well, and to have fun together performing!

#### Vice President Designer - Erica Liu
Hi! My name is Erica and I'm a current sophomore at Monta Vista High School. I play the violin and I am the assistant concertmaster of the California Youth Symphony. I will also be a 2021 NYO2 violinist. Many years ago, I would always marvel at the Farmers Market performers and the music made shopping much more enjoyable. I think MYM is a great way to develop confidence and performance skills, while sharing music with the community.

#### Vice President Promoter - Emily Wang
Hey everyone! I’m Emily Wang, a junior at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley. I’m an avid singer, and joined MYM in hopes of bringing young musicians the opportunity to be involved with art and performance again and to give back to the community that has helped me grow and develop my own passion.
