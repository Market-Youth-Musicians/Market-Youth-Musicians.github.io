We are a student run organization in the bay area founded in the Spring of 2021. We are composed of middle and high schoolers across many schools and our goal is to provide performance opportunities for youth musicians playing at the Farmers Market. We have donated to organizations around the world, including UNICEF and Calfire etc. We try to improve ourselves as musicians and performers while raising money for charities.
